// Simply CSS by Vortex
// v 1.1
/********
  Please Do Not Override Any Styles In the documents that belong to Simply-css,
  place this CSS library in a separate folder ("vendor" for instance) and load first the desired
  parts of the Simply-css, and after that you may load your custom styles to overwrite any of the Simply-css styles,
  this way it will help to keep your project organize and avoid any confusion.
  Here is an example of including the style documents:
  ````````````````````````
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="vendor/simply-css/css/styles.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="custom-styles/css/styles.css">
  ````````````````````````
  This lines of code should be located inside <head> tag and of course path of 
  the documents should match their actual location.
